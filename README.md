# Wireless-Vulnerability-Frame-Packet-Injection-Tester
I will publish this tool which i wrote in Scapy a ( a powerful Interactive Packet Manipulation Libary written in Python ) to showcase Frame Packet Injection in (Layer 2) Wireless Network. I made this for a Youtube video too . Its still in Development ,and i just tried to make it for fun to see what Custom Packet Injection Techniques could be done . the File called "packetinjection.py" has more functionalities like DNS,ARP,TCP,UDP ... Ethernet Packet Injection. This tool isnt advanced , as im still developing it for Testing Vulnerabilities in Wireless Networks.
